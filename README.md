# file to text

This project is to chunk, encrypt and compress files. It will automatically create a folder with given input under the output directory.


## why

I'll use it in my later projects. There will probably no use anything other than that.


## Run Locally

Go to the project directory
```bash
	cd filetotext
```
Configure the script && Change the key
```bash
	cd config
	*make changes*
	cd ..
```

Run the script
```bash
	python main.py <file> [filename]
```
